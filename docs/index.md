# COVID-19 Monitoring

{% include_relative _partials/agg-chart.html %}


We monitor the number of confirmed cases and growth rate to understand how quickly we can expect
the virus to spread. There are caveats with this last measure:

   - It's computed based on the number of confirmed cases each day. Given that the virus
   has an [estimated incubation period of 5 days](https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2762808/incubation-period-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-from-publicly-reported),
   there are likely more sick people each day than accounted for. This is compounded by cases
   that simply haven't been tested. This means *we can expect the actual rate to be higher
   than the one reported here*.
  - The disease is spreading at different rates around the world. The growth chart on top
  aggregates cases from everywhere, so expect regional variances depending on where you are.
